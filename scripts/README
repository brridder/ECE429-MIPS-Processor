To use the scripts found here to use ModelSim under wine:
1. Each file, modify the variable "MODELSIM_DIR" to the location of modelsim 
2. Copy each file to /usr/local/bin (or where ever your path is)

To compile verilog files: "vlog *.v"
To simulate under command line: "vsim -c TopLevelModule"
    - in the Interactive prompt: "run XXXns"
    - TopLevelModule is the top level module as given from the output of the
      vlog

To initialize your working directory: "vlib work"

DONE BAM
